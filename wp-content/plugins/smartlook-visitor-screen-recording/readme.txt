== Description ==

**Gain behavior insights with visitor recordings**

Smartlook is an intuitive — and free forever — product analytics solution with detailed visitor recordings. See how visitors interact with your website (or websites — there’s not limit to how many websites you track with Smartlook) by watching their mouse clicks, movements, and interactions. You’ll be able to see UX issues and bugs to show your developers and designers.

**Understand user behavior with heatmaps**

With various kinds of heatmaps at your disposal, you’ll be able to analyze all your pages to understand what most of your visitors are doing on them. And because new users interact with your pages differently from returning users, create heatmap filters that show data for those specific groups — then, you can compare and contrast behaviors.

**Get the big picture by tracking events**

Event tracking is here with Smartlook! No more setting up event tracking manually with your developers; Smartlook tracks all events automatically from the minute you add the code to your website. That also means you’ll be able to get retroactive data about events whenever you want to track them. Combined events data and visitor recordings means you also get context for events.

**See everything in a conversion funnel**

Build conversion funnels from events — an “add to cart” button click to check out to filled-in payment details to the “pay” button — and you can see how many visitors fall out of the funnel between each step. And because Smartlook’s funnels are paired with visitor recordings, you can watch recordings of all those churned users to see why they failed to convert.
